				Games that mobilise millions. <br>
				Games to change the world.</h1>

				<p>Games for the Many is a collective of artists, designers and developers focused on using the power of play to change politics.</p> 
				<p>Games can change the way you think. They can educate, subvert, move and inspire. We're developing games to bring people together around a shared vision for a better world. From creating the next political game to running game jams nationwide, we're using play to change the face of politics.</p>
				<p>We first worked together on the viral mobile game 'CorbynRun', launched two weeks prior to the 2017 UK General Election. We developed CorbynRun to communicate core Labour Party pledges to the public in an accessible and playful way. The game reached over 1.6 million people, received coverage on the BBC, NME, Politico, Buzzfeed, even making German primetime TV.</p>
				<p>Building on that success, we're planning new games, big and small, to help build the growing mass movement of play and politics. But we're not interested in doing this alone. Games are for sharing. Politics is a participatory process - to that end we're planning to run a series of game-jams across the country, building a community of political game makers.</p>
				<p>Join the movement and help us on our mission by becoming a patron.</p>
